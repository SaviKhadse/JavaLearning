//A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one anotherâ€™s shoulders. 
//For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. 
//Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, and A has a large 
//enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order. write a method to compute the largest 
//possible number of people in such a tower. 
//EXAMPLE: Input (ht, wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110) 
//Output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from top to bottom: (56, 90) (60,95) (65,100) (68,110) (70,150) (75,190)
